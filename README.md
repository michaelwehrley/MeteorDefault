Meteor Default

============

A basic setup for meteor - from Discover Meteor and it comes with a few packages such as bootstrap and the bootstrap log in, along with collection2 for database validations, ironrouter, moment.js, percolastestudio-migrations, spin, CoffeScript, and LoDash pre-installed.

In addition, I set up /client, /server, /lib and /public folders.
